Online is great, but presented in a physical, compelling and tactile way a business message can engage in a powerful way. Brochures and marketing sales aids are enjoying something of a resurgence, but why do many of them fail?

We think they go wrong by not following some simple golden rules. We think good brochure design should:

* have a single message or purpose at its core
* include the right balance of inspirational and informational content
* disturb the audience in a positive way
* communicate the real, the emotional
* be empathetic
* tell a story or take the reader on a journey

Simple. Well, quite complex actually because it must do all that and communicate core values and remain on brand.

At Sticky, we use a process developed over 20+ years. We call it 'Sticky Blueprint' and it helps generate ideas that help your business stick in the mind of your audience. We present these ideas as three visuals concepts -- three different options in terms of a direction of ideas -- each one designed to set you apart and be unique.

Once you're happy with the design concept, we will produce a brochure to make your business fly -- we make and deliver them right to your office, ready for you to use.
