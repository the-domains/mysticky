# Approaching 25 years of history

Sticky was established in 1992\. Actually it began in November 1992 to be exact, just a few weeks after Phil Owen and Francesca Law married and smack bang in the middle of the economic recession following the Thatcher years of the crazy 80s.

But that actually turned out to be an excellent grounding. It taught us to be focused, lean, prudent and efficient and it's a lesson we refuse to forget.

Initially we worked with medium and larger sized businesses like Esso, American Express, Guinness as well as schools, colleges and universities creating brands, brochures and all manner of marketing support literature. Then, as the internet began to show promise as a business tool we began to offer brand focused websites and tools for business entrepreneurs and larger organisations -- those who recognised the opportunity offered by this the amazing new connectivity.

In the mid 90s we created a studio in the landmark Clocktower, Southsea where we were early adopters in database driven web applications and by early 2000 we were implementing these for large recruitment companies, engineering and energy businesses.

All the time we kept improving our brand skills and expertise and married them with our digital side to enable us to offer integrated campaigns -- traditional and digital solutions that focus on effective brand communications to help grow our clients' businesses. In the mid naughties we started working with Mazuma Mobile, initially creating the brand and then an industry leading web platform on which to sell and recycle mobile devices - they've now purchased over Â£250 million via that website.

In 2010 we moved to the lovely, chilled out Boardwalk at the Port Solent Marina just north of Portsmouth and enjoyed 5 years without the frustration of city parking problems.

We are now live at historic Gatcombe House, the former residence of the Garrison Commander, and we remain immensely proud of the work that we and our clients have produced together. We have completed over well over 10,000 tradition and digital projects and we consider ourselves privileged to continue to work with our client friends, some of whom we've worked with for over 15 years.

Thanks for taking the time to consider Sticky -- we would consider ourselves lucky to talk with you about your business marketing support.
